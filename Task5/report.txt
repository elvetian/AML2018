Sleep staging from EEG/EMG

For this task we've built a convolutional neural network as proposed by Lawhern et al. [1]. 
The network starts with a temporal and depthwise convolution to learn frequency specific spatial filters. 
Then, a separable convolution learns how to optimally mix the feature maps together before passing the features to a softmax dense classifcation layer.

We used the software implementation provided by the authors at [2], configured it to our needs and conducted various experiments.
We concatenated eeg1 and eeg2 of the given data into a 2-channel sample and adjusted the number of temporal filters F1 to 8 and F2 to 16 to match our 4-second EEG signal sampled at 128 Hz (as opposed to the 2-second signal in the original implementation).
Also, we computed individual sample weights to balance sample data and performed 4-fold cross validation to prevent overfitting.
Best BMAC score we could achieve in our experiments was 0.94.
