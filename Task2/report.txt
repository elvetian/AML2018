The learning task is a multi-class classification problem.

We use Support Vector Machines SVC classifier with RBF and Linear kernel and Min-Max scaling of each feature to the range [0, 1] without feature selection in a first approach and
achieved best BMAC score of 0.61 for RBF kernel, penalty parameter C=12 and gamma=0.015.

Next we wanted to further enhance this result with Recursive Feature Elimination technique which shall remove the weakest features. To find the optimal number of features to keep 
cross validation is used with RFE to score different feature subsets and select the best scoring collection subset.

Unfortunately we couldn't finish this the feature selection procedure until deadline and remain with a best public score of 0.66 that passed the medium benchmark.
